# G7 vs BRICS: Comparative Analysis of Renewable Energy Transition (2000–2020)

This project explores the share of renewable energy in total final energy consumption across G7 and BRICS countries between 2000 and 2020. The objective is to compare how these two economic groups are progressing in the shift toward sustainable energy.

---

##  Project Objective

- Compare the renewable energy transition of G7 (developed) and BRICS (emerging) countries
- Analyze trends over time from 2000 to 2020
- Identify the top-performing country in each group
- Visualize energy share distribution using time series and boxplots

---

##  Tools & Technologies

- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **Jupyter Notebook**
- **Dataset:** [Sustainable Energy (2000–2020) – Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/anshtanwar/global-data-on-sustainable-energy)

##  Key Analysis Steps

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Removed columns with excessive missing values
   - Filtered only G7 and BRICS countries
   - Kept only relevant variables

2. **Time Series Analysis:**
   - Visualized renewable energy trends per group
   - Observed significant changes, especially post-2015

3. **Distribution Analysis (Boxplot):**
   - Compared the spread of renewable energy share in both groups
   - BRICS countries showed higher average and wider distribution

4. **Group Leader Identification:**
   - Calculated group-wise average for each country
   - Identified top country in each group based on renewable share

##  Key Findings

- BRICS countries had a **higher average renewable energy share** than G7 countries.
- G7 countries showed a **narrower and lower distribution**, indicating slower transition.
- Top-performing countries:
  - **BRICS:** Brazil  
  - **G7:** Canada
